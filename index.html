            ### 
            Development started September 2017 as an open source alternative to Driver4VR.
            The community has continued development as KinectToVR EX.

            ### Best usage and potential applications?
            - Giving a user or developer cheap access for full body tracking
            - Adding additional control options within an application
                - Joint interaction within a 3D environment
                - Cheap motion capture
                - Joint tracking

          The Basics: How does it work?

          The Kinect for Windows SDK offers tools for skeletal tracking which are then emulated into limbs for the feet
          and hips.

          Why is it a good use of VR? Why is it unique? Whatâ€™s cool about it?

          - Most applications are built with only a HMD and hand position in mind. Additional tracking points can help
            decrease simulator sickness.

          - Cost

              - Xbox One or 360 Kinect can be found for $25-50
              - In comparison, VIVE Trackers are available for $99 per tracker. ($300 for feet and hip tracking)

            ### Dizziness Rating: 1
            
            Overall, applications involving foot and hip tracking only cause slight dizziness to the user due to just
            being visual display of the user and not changing visual tracking.

            ### Weaknesses
            
            - Common issues with the Kinect is loss of tracking for when out of view from the Kinect's sensors.
            - Due to tracking limitations, the SDK cannot determine the direction the user is facing.
              Experimental builds have solved this issue.
            - Setup
                - Kinect placement
                - Syncing Kinect with SteamVR

          ### Similar applications
          - Driver4VR - Paid software which also uses the Kinect
          - Vive Trackers - $99 per puck to add additional joints within SteamVR

            ### Conclusion
            If you're looking into a cheap solution to full body tracking, KinectToVR will help you jump over many hurdles.
            There is an online community supporting the development of this application with their ideas/issues
            and therefore is rapidly increasing in features.
